Introduction
============

Strata is a C++ library for computing the multilayer Green's function (MGF) for computational electromagnetics codes based on the boundary element method. The source code can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/modelics/strata>`_. 

If you are new to Strata, we recommend that you start from the :ref:`basicusage` section. A series of examples is provided in ``strata/test/`` for a hands-on introduction to various aspects of Strata, and we strongly recommend using these examples as a starting point in your application.
